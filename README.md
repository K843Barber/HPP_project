This repo contains work from a course called High Performance Programming. The goal was to create a simulation of particles interacting with each other and to make the program as efficient as possible. I have recently reviewed the report and updated with some stylistic additions.

To run the code in each folder in 'code', you must first run 'make'. Then you will need to run './galsim' with 5 other arguments. For the purpose of the report, we used the following parameters:

A3
N: 3000
filename: ellipse_N_03000_100steps.gal
nsteps: 100
delta_t: 10^-5
graphics: 1(yes)/0(no)

A4
N: 3000
