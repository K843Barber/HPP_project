\section{Conclusions}
As expected, with LU decomposition, as the size of the matrix increases faster, the time of the computations increases faster with it. One thing that seems surprising is that the computation times for the Fredholm system are much slower for the second version of the code.
For future improvements, however, I believe that adjusting the code slightly to be able to more efficiently add parallelisation to speed up the computation time is a must.

Further ideas that could be implemented are that of involving other forms of factorization as detailed in the introduction.
